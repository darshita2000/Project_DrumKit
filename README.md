# Project_DrumKit


This project is a simple drum kit implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play different drum sounds by pressing specific keys or clicking on the provided keys on the screen.

## Usage

To use the drum kit, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Once the page is loaded, you will see a set of keys representing different drum sounds.

4. You can play the sounds in two ways:
   - By pressing the corresponding keys on your keyboard.
   - By clicking on the keys displayed on the screen using your mouse.

5. The following keys are associated with specific drum sounds:

   - **w**: Tom1 sound
   - **a**: Tom2 sound
   - **s**: Tom3 sound
   - **d**: Tom4 sound
   - **j**: Snare sound
   - **k**: Crash sound
   - **l**: Kick sound

6. Press the corresponding key or click on the displayed key to play the associated drum sound.

7. Enjoy creating your own drum beats!

## Customization

If you want to customize the drum kit or add your own sounds, follow these instructions:

1. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.

2. You will find three main files:
   - `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the drum kit.
   - `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the drum kit.
   - `index.js`: Contains the JavaScript code to handle the sound playback.

3. To add or change the drum sounds, modify the `script.js` file. You can replace the existing sound files with your own audio files. Make sure to update the corresponding key mapping in the JavaScript code as well.

4. To change the visual appearance of the drum kit, modify the `styles.css` file. You can update the styles for the keys, background, or any other element to match your desired design.

5. Save your changes and reload the `index.html` file in the web browser to see the updated drum kit.
